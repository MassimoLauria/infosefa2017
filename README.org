#+TITLE: Informatica @ SEFA 2017/2018

This is the  source code for the webpage of  the course of Informatica
for the students of SEFA 2017/2018  for the students of the [[http://www.dss.uniroma1.it][Department
of     Statistical    Sciences]]     ,     currently    published     at
[[http://www.massimolauria.net/]]courses/infosefa2017/

The idea  is that the site  is a bunch of  =org-mode= files, converted
into  a proper  webpage with  some  =org-publish= magic.  The site  is
uploaded using =rsync=.
